 
Python version of the code used for my thesis (WIP) on Computational Cognitive Modeling of Multiple Object Tracking. At the time this README was written, the following was supported in the python version:

- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Environment with point objects
- Model of Multiple Identity Tracking
- Our model for point objects: Multiple Object Tracking as Updates of Attended Locations

Subsequently, for performance in model fitting, the code has been adopted into Common Lisp (SBCL), and much of the development happens in code-lisp.

There are lots of files that still haven't been uploaded, because I haven't figured out how to organize them, or about which of them really belong to a git repository - clearly data itself does not belong here. I might upload them into a zip/tar.gz archive during thesis submission.
